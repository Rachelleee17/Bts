			<br>
			 (Korean: 김남준; born September 12, 1994),better known by his stage name <b>RM</b> (formerly Rap Monster), is a <b> South Korean rapper, songwriter, and record producer</b>. He is the leader of the South Korean boy group <b>BTS</b>. In 2015, he released his first solo mixtape, RM. In October 2018, his second mixtape, Mono, was the highest charting album by a Korean soloist on the Billboard 200 chart, having peaked at 26. He has recorded with artists such as <b>Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X</b>. <b>RM</b> selected the name <b>"Rap Monster"</b> during his time as an idol trainee. Though commonly misunderstood that the name means that he <b>"raps like a monster"</b>, it actually derives from the lyrics of a song he wrote, inspired by San E's <b>"Rap Genius"</b>. The lyrics contained a segment where San E declares he should be called a <b>"rap monster"</b> as he <b>"raps non-stop"</b>.He adopted the stage name because he felt it was <b>"cool".</b> RM has described himself as having a love-hate relationship with the name, feeling that it was not selected for being of <b>"incredible value"</b> to him.
		<br>
			He formally changed his stage name to <b>"RM"</b> in November 2017, as he determined that <b>"Rap Monster"</b> was no longer representative of who he was or the music that he creates. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight RM stated that <b>"[the name]</b> could symbolize many things. It could have more spectrums to it." <b>"Real Me"</b> was provided as a possible current meaning.</p>
